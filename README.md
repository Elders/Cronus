## **Important**

We have several success stories using the Cronus framework in production and we want to share this success with a wider audience. Hence, the main goal we are working on now is documenting the framework and providing samples. We hope this will attract contributors and allow more developers to build applications with it. You can keep an eye on the process on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Elders/projects/1) or the [milestone](https://github.com/Elders/Cronus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Docs+and+Samples%22) where we track the progress.
