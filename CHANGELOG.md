#### 3.0.1 - 22.09.2016
* Updates DomainModeling

#### 3.0.0 - 08.09.2016
* The entire workflow was reworked with Middleware execution pipeline
* Middleware for inmemory retries
* Consumers and Endpoint Factory now uses the SubscriptionsMiddlewares
* Adds support for Sagas
* Adds MessageId, CausationId, CorrelationId to all CronusMessages
* Adds validation checks when initializing EndpointConsumer
* Subscribers now care for MessageTypes of System.Type
* Uses consumer when building endpoints for propper transport initialization
* Fixed the PublishTimestamp header of the CronusMessage
* Properly destroy the container
* MessageThreshold checks removed.
* Perses: Reworked subscribers and subscription middleware. We can now support dynamic subscribing, and we can now also decuple rabbitmq specific logic for building queues etc.
* Perses: Rename TransportMessage to CronusMessage. There is a breaking change because of reorganization of the the props.

 #### 2.6.3 - 12.07.2016
* Fixed bug where Container.IsRegistered does not checks the singleton and the scoped registrations.
* Replaces the ConcurrentDictionary as a mechanizm for synchronizing with MemoryCache. The motivation behind this change is that we never invalidate the values but with MemoryCache we use sliding 30 seconds policy. In addition the MemoryCache is configured with 500mb memory cap and 10% of total physical memory cap.


#### 2.6.2 - 06.04.2016
* Fixed bug where Container.IsRegistered does not checks the singleton and the scoped registrations.

#### 2.6.1 - 19.03.2016

#### 2.6.0 - 19.03.2016
* Set default EventStreamIntegrityPolicy when Cronus starts.
* Send the publish delay directly with the EndpointMessage.
* When message is published we now attach GUID byte array as Base64 string in the message headers. Also if a message is schedules
or published with delay the publish timestamp is also attached to the message headers.
* Introduce EventStreamIntegrityPolicy which should take care about validation upon AggregateRoot loading. The resolvers only
apply InMemory fixes without writing to the database. At the moment this policy is a fact only in the UnitTests because we
need a configuration settings for this feature.

#### 2.5.0 - 19.02.2016
* Add additional ctors for AggregateCommit and mark the current as obsolete

#### 2.4.0 - 22.01.2016

* Remove log4net dependency by using LibLog #95
* Moved DefaultAggregateRootAtomicAction, IAggregateRootLock and IRevisionStore to the Cronus.AtocmicAction.Redis project.
* Added support for cluster configuration and atomic action. In memory atomic action by default.
* Prepare for new implementation of Aggregate Atomic Action #93
* Disposable MessageHander #96 #97
