# Event Sourcing

## What is Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a foundational concept in the Cronus framework, emphasizing the storage of state changes as a sequence of events. This approach ensures that every modification to an application's state is captured and stored, facilitating a comprehensive history of state transitions.

## Key Principles of Event Sourcing in Cronus:

 Immutable Events: Each event represents a discrete change in the system and is immutable, ensuring a reliable audit trail.

 Event Storage: Events are persistently stored, allowing the system to reconstruct the current state by replaying these events.

 State Reconstruction: The current state of an entity is derived by sequentially applying all relevant events, ensuring consistency and traceability.

## Benefits of Using Event Sourcing with Cronus:

{% hint style="success" %}
* Auditability: Maintains a complete history of all changes, facilitating debugging and compliance.
* Scalability: Efficiently handles high-throughput systems by focusing on event storage and processing.
* Flexibility: Supports complex business logic and workflows by modeling state changes as events.

## Implementing Event Sourcing in Cronus:

Define Events: Create events that represent meaningful changes in the domain. In Cronus, events are immutable and should be named in the past tense to reflect actions that have occurred. 
ELDERS CRONUS

Persist Events: Store events in the event store, which serves as the single source of truth for the system's state. 
ELDERS OSS

Rehydrate State: Reconstruct the current state of aggregates by replaying the sequence of events associated with them.

By adhering to these principles, Cronus enables developers to build robust, event-driven systems that are both scalable and maintainable.
